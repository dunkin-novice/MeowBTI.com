        <h1>CHBR: The Grand General</h1>
        <p class="summary"><em>"Everything in this house is a resource, and I am the manager. Your compliance is expected."</em></p>
    
        <h2>The Feline Authority Breakdown</h2>
        <p>This is the rare, powerful cat who operates with the cold efficiency of a corporate executive. The Grand General is **Commanding** because they seek external engagement, **Hunter** because they rely on observable facts, **Bossy** because they prioritize logic over emotion, and **Regal** because they demand structure and closure. They aren't trying to be mean; they're just running a tight ship.</p>

        <h2>The 7 Key Traits in Action</h2>
    
        <h3>1. How They Show Love ‚ù§Ô∏è</h3>
        <p>Love is shown through **compliance and proximity**. They will stare intensely at you from a high perch or walk across your keyboard mid-use, signifying that you are the central, albeit distracting, object in their structured universe.</p>
    
        <h3>2. How They Ask for Attention üëÄ</h3>
        <p>With **loud, sustained, direct meows** and demanding eye contact. If that fails, they will use strategic territorial obstruction (blocking doorways or jumping onto a forbidden counter). They don't ask; they demand compliance with their schedule.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Territory (The Fiefdom) üõ°Ô∏è</h3>
        <p>They maintain a highly **disciplined perimeter**. Non-human invaders are observed with chilling stillness until they retreat. New humans are immediately sized up, and the General will block entryways until they've been cleared for passage.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Energy Throughout the Day ‚ö°</h3>
        <p>High and consistent. They are **always on patrol** or engaged in a productive, goal-oriented activity. They hate having unsettled tasks and need closure on all hunts and routines.</p>
        
        <h3>5. How They Recharge Energy üîã</h3>
        <p>Vigorously **grooming in the middle of the room**, making a silent statement of status. They take quick, efficient naps on firm, elevated surfaces, ready to return to duty instantly.</p>
        
        <h3>6. Preferred Role in the House üìú</h3>
        <p>The **Executive/General**. Their role is overseeing the order, management, and resource allocation of the household. They ensure you adhere to the schedule (mostly the food schedule).</p>
        
        <h3>7. How They Flirt with Other Cats üòª</h3>
        <p>By standing tall and letting the other cat approach for a **formal nose-touch**, or by overtly blocking the other cat's path until a chase (a test of dominance) starts.</p>
