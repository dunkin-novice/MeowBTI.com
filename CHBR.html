        <h1>CHBR: The Grand General</h1>
        <p class="summary"><em>"Everything in this house is a resource, and I am the manager. Your compliance is expected."</em></p>
        
        <h2>The Feline Authority Breakdown</h2>
        <p>This is the rare, powerful cat who operates with the cold efficiency of a corporate executive. The Grand General is Commanding, Hunter, Bossy, and Regal. They aren't trying to be mean; they're just running a tight ship.</p>
    
        <h2>The 7 Key Traits in Action</h2>
        
        <h3>1. How They Show Love ‚ù§Ô∏è</h3>
        <p>Love is shown through compliance and proximity. They will stare intensely at you from a high perch or walk across your keyboard mid-use.</p>
        
        <h3>2. How They Ask for Attention üëÄ</h3>
        <p>With loud, sustained, direct meows and demanding eye contact. If that fails, they will use strategic territorial obstruction.</p>
